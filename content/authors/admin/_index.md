I am a prospective Ph.D. student planning to study in the United States. I earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Applied Statistics at Konkuk University under the supervision of professor Kyusang Yu.

My ultimate professional goal is to be a scholar developing applied statistical methodologies. In the future, I hope to do postdoc training in the public health sector and engage with other scientists in interdisciplinary studies. Then I desire to work as a faculty and develop methodologies for the most complex human diseases.
