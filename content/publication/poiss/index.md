abstract: The purpose of this study is to analyze the dynamics of the Health and Welfare Committee’s legislative motion, which has shown a rapid increase in recent years. Most previous studies on the issue have argued that the lawmakers were mainly proposing the legislation that maximized the probability of being re-elected. However this type of aggregated analysis has limitations when it comes to explaining an increase in the individual standing committees’ legislative proposals. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the motives of and a background behind the increase in parliamentary legislation hidden in the aggregate data. During the first half of the 20th National Assembly, this research was designed to analyze the current status of the proposals by party, constituency/ proportional, seniority, gender and expand the scope of bill proposals study to the level of issues, the scale of budgets, and the timing of presidential election that could not be addressed in advance by research based on the aggregate data. The results of this study suggest that the group that led legislation related to the health and welfare issues was mainly composed of the female lawmakers and proportional representatives. Policy conflicts and competition between the progressive and conservative parties have had a significant impact on the increase in the number of legislative bills. In addition, the larger the size of the budget, the more active the proposal of the bill was. Finally, election pledges did not directly affect the number of legislative proposals, but there were differences in the scope of legislative proposals before and after the 19th Presidential election when the change of government took place.
